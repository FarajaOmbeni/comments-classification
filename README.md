# Comment Classification Project

## Project Overview

The **Comment Classification Project** focuses on the task of categorizing textual comments into predefined categories. This task is crucial in fields such as social media moderation, customer feedback analysis, and sentiment analysis. The main objective of this project is to develop a machine learning model capable of classifying comments into different categories based on their content.

The project involves the use of deep learning techniques with **TensorFlow** in **Google Colab** to build and train the model. The dataset used for training and testing contains labeled comments that are categorized based on their sentiment or content.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project is provided by Kaggle through the **Jigsaw Toxic Comment Classification Challenge**. The dataset consists of comments that need to be classified into categories such as toxic, non-toxic, and others. The dataset and rules for participation can be accessed through the link below:

## Implementation Steps

1. **Data Loading and Exploration**
   - Loading the training and test datasets to begin working with the data
   - Analyzing data distribution and class balance to understand potential biases in the dataset
   - Handling missing values and performing basic data cleaning to ensure data quality
   - This step is crucial for understanding the data and identifying potential challenges

2. **Text Preprocessing**
   - Tokenizing the text data using TensorFlow's Tokenizer to convert words into numerical format
   - Converting text to sequences to make the data suitable for neural network input
   - Padding sequences to ensure uniform length, as neural networks require fixed-size inputs
   - Splitting data into training and validation sets to properly evaluate model performance
   - These preprocessing steps are essential for converting raw text into a format the model can process

3. **Model Architecture**
   - Building a Sequential model with:
     - Embedding layer to create dense vector representations of words
     - LSTM layers to capture sequential patterns in the text
     - Dense layers with dropout to prevent overfitting
   - Configuring model with binary cross-entropy loss and Adam optimizer
   - This architecture was chosen for its effectiveness in natural language processing tasks

4. **Training**
   - Training the model for 5 epochs to learn patterns in the data
   - Using early stopping to prevent overfitting by monitoring validation metrics
   - Monitoring validation accuracy and loss to track model performance
   - These training strategies help ensure the model learns effectively without overfitting

5. **Evaluation**
   - Evaluating model performance on validation set to assess generalization
   - Generating classification metrics to understand model strengths and weaknesses
   - Analyzing model predictions to identify areas for improvement
   - This evaluation helps understand how well the model performs and where it needs enhancement

## Approach

The project uses **TensorFlow** and a **Sequential neural network** architecture with LSTM layers to process the comments. Preprocessing includes tokenization, padding, and vectorization to convert the raw text data into a format suitable for the model.

The model is trained using a **cross-entropy loss function** and optimized with the **Adam optimizer**.

## Goals

- To classify comments into multiple categories such as positive, negative, and neutral.
- To enhance the model's performance with possible improvements, including model architecture, hyperparameter tuning, and data augmentation.
